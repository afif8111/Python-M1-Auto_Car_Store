# Python-M1-Auto_Car_Store
A Python Code Module 1 (DTI-DS Purwadhika School). This repository showcasing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, with car store simulation use-case.
## General Info
I created a Python program to simulate car store activity. The user will be divided, as an Admin or a Customer. The Admin could Add and Remove the car that exists in the database, and the Customer could buy, rent, or sell a car. When the customer sell the car. This program created in hope to simulate simple activity that exists in the car store. The program use dictionary data collection types.
## Features:
1. Login: User need to login to differentiate whether the user is an Admin or Customer. (For simulation purposes, user just need to select yes/no('y/n') after asked whether the user an admin or not.
2. Display: User can see the lists of the car, whether it is listed as sales or rent
3. Add Car: Admin can add new car type whether it is for sale or for rent. After the admin added the new car, the database will be updated.
4. Remove Car: Admin can remove the car whether it is from sale section or rent section. The database will be updated afterwards.
5. Logout: Admin can logout, back to the login selection to change user.
6. Buy Car: Customer can select which car that would like to buy from the lists
7. Rent Car: Customer can select which car that would like to rent from the lists. The customer can input the rent duration as well.
8. Sell Car: Customer, customer could sell their car.
## Usage:
Upon running the program, user will be prompted to login. After selecting admin/customer, user will be presented with a menu which consits of several lists of menu.
## Dependencies and Environment Requirements:
